# yEdPowerNetworks
Visualization of power networks using yEd graphing software

A Python script 'write_yEd.py' writes a 'tgf' file for a graphics editor yEd. This file when opened in yEd displays a network graph. A matpower file is used as an input. Numerous examples of standards power systems test cases can be found under the folder diagrams.
